Hey, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if this code doesn't work
That said, it should be pretty close, so I'd maybe try running it

You'll wanna make sure that you step down the voltages somehow before you run this code also.

I can definitely help you more with this though, and I'm super happy to walk through the code with you and work on implementing new features and stuff.

Yeah, sorry, the code is pretty much all for() loop hell

If you don't already have it, you'll wanna download the arduino IDE (integrated development enviorment) from arduino.cc

Depending on how you download the file, you might be prompted with an error saying that the file needs to be in a folder with the same filename, just click like yes or continue, it'll just nest the code in a folder so it can run properly (its weird)

When in the ide with the code, connect your board, and check to make sure that your board is connected (on the top toolbar go to "tool" then port and select the one that says usb) then you should be able to press the sideways arrow on the top of the arduino IDE ui (its next to the check mark).

if it gives you an error google it or ask me about it, everything arduino is super well documented.

Uhh, I work Monday: 6-9, Wednesday: 3-6, and Friday: 3-6
That said, pretty much everyone in the make space knows how to do this stuff.
